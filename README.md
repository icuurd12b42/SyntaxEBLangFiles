# SyntaxEBLangFiles
The language files used by tmcsyntaxEB

The SyntaxEBLangFiles folder (the folder that contains all the .lng files, not the one where this readme is located) belongs in the same location where the tmcsyntaxED dll is located. The sub folder will be searched by the dll to see the language options possible.
